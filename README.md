Why "*Guichet*" ? [Because](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000029461191&dateTexte=&oldAction=dernierJO&categorieLien=id).

### How to use ?

Thanks to SVN support on Github, we can use a SVN feature to quick download all the content of the `dist` directory without the versioning system and other useless files.

```bash
svn export --force https://github.com/KitaeAgency/guichet/trunk/dist/ ./
```

It will download the content of the `dist` directory into your current folder.

**Note:** If you have the [Two-Factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/) activated on your GitHub account, you may have to [create an access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) to use as password for SVN in CLI.
